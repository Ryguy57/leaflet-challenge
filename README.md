## Summary
This repository offers an interactive earthquake map crafted in JavaScript using Leaflet and D3.js. The map pinpoints earthquake locations with circle markers, where the marker size signifies the earthquake's magnitude and its color the depth. Users can pull 7-day GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS API, view details like location and time on pop-ups, and switch between Street and Topographic map views. The map also features a color-coded depth legend. To use, simply clone the repository and open the index.html in a browser, allowing customization of the map type and marker management. The code is neatly organized into distinct functions for clarity, harnessing modern JavaScript (ES6) and focusing on data fetching, marker generation, and map presentation. It depends on Leaflet.js and D3.js for its functionalities. Credit goes to the US Geological Survey (USGS) for providing the earthquake data.
